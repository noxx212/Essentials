This project started because I kept reinstalling Windows to fix FPS drops, and I got tired of setting up everything from scratch. So, I made this friendly tool that installs all the software I use every dayâ€”games, productivity apps, utilitiesâ€”automatically. It saves time, avoids mistakes, and gets your system ready to go in minutes, whether youâ€™re a gamer, a multitasker, or just want a clean setup.
